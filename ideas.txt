multiple player idea
either a square for 4 people
or 4 people mode where 2 players share 1 half of the stick
ofc they can block each other to annoy each other
could also extend that bit with more plaers, each time seperating the stick into more

livechat module could be easily implemented similar to irc, with invite and private messages

definitely do the cybersecurity module.
