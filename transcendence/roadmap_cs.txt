Automate Vault Initialization & Unseal
Vault initialization generates unseal keys and the root token.

Normally, unseal keys are split into shares to be entered manually.

But you can automate this by running vault operator init once, capturing the keys securely (e.g., in an encrypted storage or external secret manager).

Then use vault operator unseal automatically with the stored keys during container startup.

How to automate:

Create a script or entrypoint that checks if Vault is initialized (vault status).

If not initialized, run vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1 (for simplicity).

Store the unseal key and root token securely somewhere (e.g., encrypted file, cloud secret store).

Automatically run vault operator unseal <key> with the stored key.

Set environment variable VAULT_TOKEN to the root token for automated login.

2. Automate Certificate Issuance
Use Vault’s PKI secrets engine to dynamically generate certificates.

Pre-configure roles and policies in Vault to allow cert issuance.

Have a startup script or your app call Vault’s API to request certificates when Vault is ready.

3. Store Vault Data Persistently
Use bind mounts or cloud storage for Vault’s storage backend (e.g., Consul, S3).

This ensures data and keys survive restarts and migrations.

4. Secrets Bootstrap & Configuration
Automate the creation of policies, roles, and secrets engines during first startup or via a provisioning script.

Use Terraform or Vault CLI/API calls to apply your Vault configuration declaratively.

5. Security Considerations
Store unseal keys securely (never commit to git).

Consider using Auto-Unseal with a cloud KMS or HSM for production (removes manual unseal).

Protect your Vault token with environment variables or secure injection.

Quick example skeleton for Docker entrypoint script:
sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/sh
if ! vault status > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Initializing Vault..."
  vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1 -format=json > /vault/init.json
  UNSEAL_KEY=$(jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[0]' /vault/init.json)
  ROOT_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.root_token' /vault/init.json)
  echo "$UNSEAL_KEY" > /vault/unseal.key
  echo "$ROOT_TOKEN" > /vault/root.token
  vault operator unseal "$UNSEAL_KEY"
else
  echo "Vault already initialized"
fi

vault operator unseal $(cat /vault/unseal.key)
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /vault/root.token)

exec vault server -config=/vault/config/vault.hcl
